### 1. What voltage needs to be supplied to the power jack? Is the NUC power supply sifficient to power the whole system?
### 2. What is the current draw of the whole system? / OR what capacity and specs for batteries di you use?  
### 3. Torso control board, which position for the key is "on"  
### 4. What voltage is requires for the torso control board? Is the USB conenction sufficient, or does it require power from the jack in addition?
### 5. Where would I find the schematics for the Torso control board (and really every other board designed by Callum?)  
### 6. What do you think will be the biggest issue with updating to latest version (distro) of ROS?
