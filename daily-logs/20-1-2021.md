# Porting old ROS packages Part 2: Segway RMP  
## Background
The RMP packages proved to be very problematic to port!  
The issue was actually, (slightly) unclear documentation rather than any real tehnical challenge - as there are multiple libraries for the RMP authored by the same dev.  
It took me multiple hours of a very strange error that came up when I tried to build the package, and then digging through forums, ensuring all my dependencies were correctly setup - trawling through more fourms to fully debug the dependencies, etc.  
Only to then find upon re-reading the documentation for the original (ROS Melodic build) repo for the rmp package, did I see a note on the master branch on one of teh most recent commits that there was a potnentially breaking error and that anyone wanting to use the repo should use a different branch!!!!!  
So I cloned the stable branch into the <ROS_PACKAGE_PATH> (/opt/ros/melodic/share/) and then as the wiki instructed, ran $ rosmake  
Success! It seemed to build succesfully. To further ensure everything builds correctly, I went into my catkin workspace and ran $ catkin_make  and as expected, built without trouble!  

## Further steps
Now I need to ensure that the package functiuons correctly in runtime...
