# Porting old RMP packages part 5: Building packages from source!
## Background
No word yet from Stanley innovation, so for the time being I'm going to assume they won't be any help.   
This is problematic as it means **I will have to build the old RMP drivers from source**.  
This is quite daunting as it's a collection of very complex source code I don't really understand.  
**What I do know right now:**  
- The rmp package that sits in `catkin_ws/src`, called: `segway-rmp-ros-pkg` requires two other packages: **libsegwayrmp** and **segway-rmp-serial**  
- Trying to compile the `segway-rmp-ros-pkg` package, results in an error that says it's missing the directory for the cmake files for `libsegwayrmp`
- The `libsegway-rmp` package is very problematic, it's very unclear where it is supposed to sit as it **does not belong in** `catkin_ws/src`.   
  Placing the package results in errors saying it is not a catkin package, which makes sense as the package is supposed to be cross platform (i.e. not just for catkin build environments!)  
- There is another directory it *seems* libsegwayrmp is supposed to sit: the other ros source directoy. running `$ env | grep CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/ros/melodic`

## `libsegwayrmp` list of actions taken
- cloning the directory into home, and running `$ make` gets 14% of the way through and results in the error:  
  `/home/saulramsay/libsegwayrmp/src/segwayrmp.cc:825:19: error:   
      non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'unsigned char' to  
      'char' in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]  
  char data[4] = {llow, lhigh, hlow, hhigh};`  
  
- cloning the directory into the above `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/ros/melodic` and then running `$ make` gets 16% through and then results in this error:  
  `/opt/ros/melodic/libsegwayrmp/src/segwayrmp.cc:825:19: error:   
      non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'unsigned char' to  
      'char' in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]  
  char data[4] = {llow, lhigh, hlow, hhigh};`  
  
- It seems to be an issue with CMake not being able to find the `CMakeLists.txt` file for libsegwayrmp...

## Possible Lead?
So going after the issue of CMake not being able to find a config file for the segway rmp, adding `set(libsegwayrmp_DIR "/opt/ros/melodic/libsegwayrmp/build/cmake")` to the `CMakeLists.txt` file in `segway-rmp-ros-pkg` fixes the issue! But now there are errors with variables an packages not being found.. Which makes sense (somewhat) as the libsegwayrmp package can't build on it's own..  
**Building the `libsegwayrmp` package from it's directory** yields a bunch of errors about narrowing unsigned char to char and what not. It seems the workound for this is to add a compiler directive - in the packages CMake file `-Wno-narrowing`.  
  
So going into the `CMakeLists.txt` file and adding the following:  



````markdown
# Allows to add flags for all compiler calls
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "{CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra")

# Add directive  to ignore narrowing type error (as it is actually a warning)
add_definitions(-Wno-narrowing)` 
````

**Still yields an error!!!**  

I think it might be worth reconsidering direction for this...
