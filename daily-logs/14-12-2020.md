Finally may have cracked the issue preventing me from running $ roscore  
Machine can't png itself and I was getting error saying it couldn't connect to it's own server.  
Luckily, however ROS has a troubleshooting command: $ roswtf.  After running this command I've been given a few leads.  
1. The current 'ROS_HOSTNAME' [marvin] resolves to the addr: 192.168.20.120, which isn;t a valid ip address anymore, as opposed to 127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.100. It seems the later is the new ip address.  
2. The ROS_MASTER_URI is set to: "http://192.168.20.120" as well. this is causing trouble for the same reason, it isn't a valid address anymore.  
So to fix this it seems that I need to change both the ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_HOSTNAME from any mention of 192.168.20.120 to 192.168.20.100  
SOme useful details (specific to indigo) can be found (here)[https://amiithinks.github.io/RobotLearning/TurtlebotSetup.html]  
It seems the setting sare in the bashrc file, accessde by running (from the home directory) $ sudo nano ~/.bashrc  
Right at the bottom of the file is what the ROS_MASTER_URI is set to. Currently it is: http://marvin:11311  



**Manual details:**  
If the router is reset, the addresses for both "ROS_MASTER_URI" and the address the 'MARVIN' hostname resolves to has to be changed.   
To find the new address run $ ifconfig
