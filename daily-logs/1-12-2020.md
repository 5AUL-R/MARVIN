- Reset the passord and configuration credentials on MARVIN's router (although I still can't SSH into the damn NUC)  
- Yesterday I talked to Callum and got a few answers (see Questions for Callum).  
- yesterday I also dissasembled some of MARVIN's wires to get a better sense for where everything is and to also remove redudnat wires and etc.  
- Today I've been tracking down what plugs into what for the power board (as not everything is labelled, for example there are four ports on the power board simply labelled 'AUX')
