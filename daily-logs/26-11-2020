I got him to stand on his own and move properly!!!
I inflated the tyres and that seemed to solve the issue with ROS detecting too much movement.  
TO get him to run I ran the following commands;  
$ roscore  
$ roslaunch marvin_control marvin_transport.launch  
I tried to ssh into him with the control laptop, but ran into issues with MARVIN's network connection I suspect I need to connect to the 'MARVIN' network   
That's tomorrow's problem though
