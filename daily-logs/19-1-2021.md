# porting old ROS packages Part 1
Today wasn't as productive as I was hoping. However, with that being said I did learn a few very important key concepts relating to catkin, ROS's build environment.  
- Porting old packages is actually relatively straighfoward
- Porting packages is simply the process of copying the source files (files found in the /src directory within the catkin workspace  'catknin_ws' directory) to the new catkin ws and building the catkin ws.  
This usually works provided the following hasn't happened:  
- The source files are actually catkin packages (i.e. they aren;t missing a package.xml file)  
- The CMake.txt doesn't use any macros for 'rosbuild' (the old build environment ROS used prior to catkin)  
The build process may still encounter errors, but they usually give some guidance as to the necessary changes needed.  
Most of the time, the changes required are:  
- Updating method calls to new signatures
- updating / replacing used message types 
- creating replacements for depreciated / removed api calls  
After this, it comes down to testing runtime behavior - this may prove difficult what with the use of the RMP, but additionally having to understanding teh serial protocal of the rmp.
