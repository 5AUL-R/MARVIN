**Today I did three things:**  
1. Installed Ubuntu on the control laptop for MARVIN
2. Backed up all of the important files from MARVIN (Catkin workspace etc.)
3. Established that the PID control for MARVIN's Segway RMP *is not* handled in ROS and is in fact handled directly by the RMP (The segway RMP 200 has a button specifically to place the unit in 'dynamic stabilisation mode')  
Initially I tried to control MARVIN by starting the RMP and leaving it in it's default mode on startup 'Tractor Mode' (which is designed to not stand upright but to lean on a support)  
then after starting teh RMP, starteiong roscore then the launch file for manual control and then finally placing the RMP into DS mode.  
Doing this resulted in an error in which one of the nodes (can't remember which one exactly, most likely MARVIN_control) threw the error "too much change in rmp linear velocity, shutting down motors".  
This means that there is some issue with the code, I suspect it could be that the RMP is having to move more than expected as the tyres for teh RMP are very flat.  
  
**Actions for tomorrow:**  
- Find what tyre pressure the tyres should be at (this will likely be in the RMP 200 manual) 
- Inflate the tyres to the target pressure from above  
- Find the threshold in linear velocity change in the source code
