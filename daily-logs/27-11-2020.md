Spent most of teh day trying to get network connectiviety with MARVIN to allow wireless control with the control laptop.  
MARVIN comes with a TP-Link TL-WR702N wireless router broadcasting the network 'MARVIN'. I can't seem to get access to the network, as it requires an 8 character password, and the only reasonable passwords I can think of: 'MARVIN" "marvin" "  " and finally "        " do not work.   
In fact, all pof the above attempts, with exception of the latter (the eight spaces) can't be attempted as the passsword for the network as it requires a password of AT LEAST eight characters.  
So I've spent most of the day trying to find how to configure the network MARVIN is broadcasting, the ip address to confure the router does not work.  
I went into the IPv4 settings in the netowkr menu for the MARVIN ethernet connection set the address, Netmask and Gateway as follows:  
192.168.20.1 , 255.255.255.0 , 192.168.0.10  
and entering any one of these does not work browser says "unable to connect".  
I'll be talking to Callum on Monday, so hopefully he can shed soem light on this, if not I may have to go with the password cracker I was trying to install on the control laptop yesterday.
