Back for the year!  
# Recap on issues with MARVIN:  
$ roscore wouldn't run because of issues with the network. Resetting the router to get access to the network password, seemed to have reset some other important details. **So important** that ROS's core service can't run.  
When attempted to run the command: $ roscore the terminal spits out the following error:  
  
"unable to connect to my own server at [http://marvin:52553/].  
This usually means that the network is not configured properly.  
A common cause is that the machine cannot ping itself, Please check for errors by running $ ping marvin  
For more tips, please see:  
(http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup)[http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/NetworkSetup]  
the traceback error was written to the log file"  
  
This was tested with a ping to 'marvin'. No response (100% packet loss after letting it run for a good few minutes to be sure).
  
I ran '$ roswtf' to get a bit more information and this is what I found:  
  
I noticed that the address 'ROS_HOSTNAME' [marvin] resolves to 192.168.20.120 - which isn't valid  
following the router reset - as I couldn't find that IP when running $ ifconfig.   
  
I had a look at some of the new network settings, like what IP address the router now has, and after a bit of digging I found it was either:
127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.100
(I couldn't see any mention of the address: 192.168.20.120 ).
   
I tried to find a way to change the address 'ROS_HOSTNAME' [marvin] resolves to, but I couldn't find anything.  
I found some details on changing ROS_MASTER_URI (which was also set to the problematic old IP of "http://192.168.20.120").  
I found the address for "ROS_MASTER_URI" was set to "http://marvin:11311" in the bashrc file (found under: /etc/hosts)   
  
**Steps forward / possible solutions**  
- Change the network name back from 'MARVIN_WIRELESS' to 'MARVIN'  
- Reset the router and the NUC's wireless settings  
- Callum suspects the netmask on the wireless adaptor is incorrect (which means they just need to also be reset and put back to DNS?)  
- Should I just go ahead and update the NUC now?? Maybe give it a couple of days...  

# Results today  
## Got $ roscore running again!!!  
The issue came from resetting the router which changed the ip of the NUC.  
I changed the settings of the router from "Smart IP (DHCP)" to "Static IP".  
I then went into $ ifconfig to find the IP of the NUC, which was under "wlan0".  
Then I had to use that IP to set "ROS_MASTER_URI" and "ROS_HOSTNAME" with the following commands:  
- echo export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://NUC_IP:11311 >> ~/.bashrc  
- echo export ROS_HOSTNAME=NUC_IP >> ~/.bashrc
  
**Questions I now have**  
- What network config do I actually need (e.g. DHCP? static?)  
- How will this affect my ability to connect the laptop to the NUC now??  
- Should I just go ahead and update the damn thing??
